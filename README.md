# FDA for Imaging Data - Technical Article

In this repository I keep the codes used for the article:

Arias-López, J. A., Cadarso-Suárez, C., & Aguiar-Fernández, P. (2021). Computational Issues in the Application of Functional Data Analysis to Imaging Data (pp. 630–638). https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86960-1_46

Everything is run using R and the scripts should be complete and with enough comments for anyone to understand in case they want to replicate the results. Long life open science!
